                My name is Juliana Rosen.
                <br \>
                I am majoring in Computer Science.

                My IP address is: 2601:184:487f:a80:e14d:7d65:9739:4c40
                <br />
                I grew up in Woodside, CA.
                <br />
                Something no one would guess about me is that I lived in Costa Rica for 6 months when I was in kindergarten.

                This is a picture I took when I was on vacation in Costa Rica this summer. It is my favorite place!
